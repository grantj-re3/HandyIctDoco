# AsciiDoc format

This is an plain text (ASCII) documentation format which can be read
intuitively in raw format since it uses simple markup. It can also be
processed to produce other formats including:
- ebook formats PDF and epub
- HTML pages
- man pages

For example, the Pro Git 2nd Edition ebook was written in this format.
See http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 and https://github.com/progit/progit2

This documentation format is processed by Asciidoctor (and formerly
AsciiDoc). See http://asciidoctor.org/#authors

## Newer - Ruby based

Asciidoctor is a drop-in replacement for the original AsciiDoc Python
processor.

Can be processed in Ruby, Java VM and JavaScript environments.
