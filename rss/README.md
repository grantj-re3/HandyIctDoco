## RSS in a nutshell

- RSS provides a means for content providers (including news channels,
  web masters, bloggers and repository managers) to update or notify
  consumers of new content.
- The content provider makes an (XML) RSS page available on the
  internet (typically via a web server).
- If the consumer subscribes to the RSS page, their RSS reader
  will poll the page regularly looking for updates. If there are any
  updates, the RSS reader will take appropriate action which may
  include a notification to the consumer.
- Many web browsers and email clients also include some RSS reading
  capability. Mozilla Firefox for example has a native feature called
  Live Bookmarks which updates RSS-channel bookmarks based on new
  information discovered via RSS polling. Firefox can also have other
  RSS features via add-ons (ie. plugins).
