# Finite State Machine

## Introduction

1. [UC Computer Science Education | Finite State Automata - An Introduction (playlist) | 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A42PgbxHNQA4p1SdZYv2a9ByWIBB2KJ)
   - 8 very short videos (less than 2 minutes each) created at the University of Canterbury

1. MATLAB; Will Campbell | Understanding State Machines | 2014

     * Designs an oven Finite State Machine
   - [Part 2: Why Use Them?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z0XGXBtI3A)
     * Discusses ATM and oven Finite State Machines
     * Discusses a State Transition Diagram vs requirements document
     * A State Transition Diagram can serve as a high-level starting point for a complex software design process

1. [Barry Brown | Finite State Machines: Part 1 | 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XEK7OU2gIw)
   - Designs a Finite State Machine for a robot vacuum cleaner
   - Uses paper then a State Machine Simulator

1. [FREGE: A Logic Course Elaine Rich, Alan Cline | Finite State Machines (video) | 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh2onWfBrxk)
   - University of Texas, Computer Science
   - FREGE: Fundamentals of Reasoning for the Electronic Age
   - Definition of a FSM
   - Discusses an FSM which selects a soccer team with the *right* gender mix
   - Discusses an FSM for a Vending Machine
   - Discusses an FSM for detecting a *leet-speak* word
   - Discusses an FSM for traffic lights
   - The Essence of an FSM: *If two strings share all futures they drive the FSM to the same state*


## Theory, programming and more detail

1. hhp3; Portland State University; Prof. Harry Porter | Finite State Machines | 2015
   - [Lecture 2/65: Finite State Machines: Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuGs7WhlHWA)
     * Gives definitions, components, rules, maths symbols, etc. for FSMs
     * Discusses a sample FSM which processes a string of 1s and 0s
   - [Lecture 3/65: Finite State Machines: Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6veoK7DRv_w)
     * Terminology
     * Designs an FSM which recognises a string which does **not** contain a particular bit pattern
     * The "Dead" state is frequently omitted
     * Definition of Computation
     * Definition of a Regular Language. What languages are *not* regular?
       + E.g. 1: Cannot store a string
       + E.g. 2: Cannot count
     * Designs an FSM which recognises binary numbers that are divisible by 3

1. [Gary Explains; Gary Sims | Understanding Finite State Machines (or Finite-State Automaton) (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OiWs-h_M3A)
   - Walks through his State Diagram and Python code for a Traffic Light FSM
   - Walks through his State Diagram and Python code for an FSM to check for a "Good Number"

1. [The Shaggy Dev | An introduction to finite state machines and the state pattern for game development (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZP2Xm-mY4E)
   - Professional software developer who also makes games and music in their free time
   - Uses pseudo-code
   - Gives section headings with timestamps
     * Life without state machines
     * Finite state machines
     * Using enumerators
     * The state pattern
     * Final thoughts and where to go next

1. [iHeartGameDev; Nicky Boccuzzi | How to Program in Unity: State Machines Explained | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt8aZDPzRjI)
   - 0m0s to 8m30s covers concepts with graphics and pseudo-code (whereas real code starts after 8m30s)
   - Presenter is a game developer
   - Gives section headings with timestamps
     * What is State?
     * Anything Can Have State
     * What does State do?  It decides behaviour.
     * What is the State Pattern? The code for each state is self-contained.
     * Bad-Implementation Apple Pseudocode
     * Making it more complex
     * Why This is bad
     * How do we use the state pattern to fix this

1. [One Wheel Studio | The State Pattern (C# and Unity) - Finite State Machine | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnrOhb5UdRc)
   - Assumes you understand FSM basics
   - This game developer discusses the behaviour of Non-Playable Characters; an NPC is a character programmed to behave in a predictable way
   - Mostly talk and discussing code fragments; no diagrams or pseudo-code
