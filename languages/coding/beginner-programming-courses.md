## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

### Why are data structures & algorithms important?

- Program maintainability (i.e. can you and others understand and modify the code?)
- Troubleshooting and debugging speed (i.e. can you find/fix your bug once instead of in 50 copy/paste places?)
- Program performance (i.e. speed)
- Program runtime memory footprint (i.e. how much memory will your variables/data/program require)
- The above issues are magnified when:
  * the task being performed by the code is complex
  * the code base becomes very big
  * the data being processed becomes very big

Often, the answer to the above question on internet is "DSA is important so I can do well
in an interview and get a job". Although this answer is applicable for developers seeking
employment, I have ignored this above because it gives rise the the secondary question
"Why does your potential employer want to employ someone who is proficient with DSA?"
