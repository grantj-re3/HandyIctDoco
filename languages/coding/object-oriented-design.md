# Object Oriented Design

## Sandi Metz

1. [Confreaks | GORUCO 2009 - SOLID Object-Oriented Design by Sandi Metz (video) | 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-2yFMzxqwU)
   - SOLID is about managing dependencies in your apps
   - Discusses O (open/closed), S (single responsibility) and D (dependency injection).
     I (interface segregation) is not really applicable in Ruby.

     * Code smell: Don't use "isKindOf()"
     * TDD = Test-driven development
     * [Mock](https://www.telerik.com/products/mocking/unit-testing.aspx) = dependencies are
       replaced by... objects that simulate the behavior of the real ones

   - 10m52s The coding examples start here
   - Need to define a role for each object
   - OOP perhaps should be called Message Oriented Programming
