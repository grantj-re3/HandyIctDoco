1. [UMLBoard | Relations | 2023](https://www.umlboard.com/docs/relations/)
   - UML supports six different types of relations
   - ... Association (which can be further specified as Aggregation or Composition)
   - While associations refer to a *has-a* relationship, a generalization expresses a much stronger, *is-a* relation.
   - *Has-a* relationships can be very dynamic - the instances on each edge can be changed anytime during runtime and even set to null.
   - Generalizations [*is-a* relationships] ... will remain over your application's whole lifetime.
