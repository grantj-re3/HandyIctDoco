     “biggest lie on the web”: almost no one really reads the terms of service we agree to all the time.
   - [Classification](https://www.tosdr.org/classification) - ToS;DR aims at creating a transparent and
     peer-reviewed process to rate and analyse Terms of Service and Privacy Policies in order to create
