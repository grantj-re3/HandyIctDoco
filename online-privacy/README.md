       webmail services) as a solution to "improve email
       security" does not improve online privacy. See Google
       and email articles above.

   - “Terms of Service; Didn't Read” (short: ToS;DR) is a project started in June 2012 to help fix the
     “biggest lie on the web”: almost no one really reads the terms of service we agree to all the time.
   - [Classification](https://www.tosdr.org/classification) - ToS;DR aims at creating a transparent and
     peer-reviewed process to rate and analyse Terms of Service and Privacy Policies in order to create
     a rating from Grade A to Grade E.

1. End-to-end encryption (E2EE)
   - Summary:
     * Used for email, messaging apps, cloud storage, VPNs, etc.
     * Vulnerable areas may exist at end points, back doors or where users are careless.
     * For most implementations, loss of your private key means you can no longer decrypt your emails/messages.

       + I believe government-sanctioned backdoors in encryption will
         increase the possibility that anyone can walk through it, whether
         it’s the intended government agency, a malicious nation or hackers.
       + The answer is very simple, the key should not be held by such
         companies and the key guardians should not have access to the data
         unless a legal and out-of-band process is performed.
       + It works by splitting a decryption key into multiple fragments that
         are then transmitted to fragment guardians... The message can only
         be accessed if a pre-agreed quorum threshold is reached... for
         example, 3 out of 5 fragment guardians will need to approve the
         request before access to the data is granted.

       + No one who knows anything about encryption will ever say it’s possible to create a “good guys only” backdoor.
