1. Email alias services

   - I understand the providers below offer both privacy and encryption:
     * [SimpleLogin (by Proton AG) | Home page](https://simplelogin.io/) [PGP encryption]
     * [addy.io | Home page](https://addy.io/) [PGP encryption]
     * [StartMail | Home page](https://www.startmail.com/) [PGP encryption]
   - I understand the providers below offer privacy but not encryption:
     * [DuckDuckGo Email Protection | web page](https://duckduckgo.com/email/)
     * [33Mail | Home page](https://33mail.com/)
     * [Firefox Relay | Home page](https://relay.firefox.com/)
   - You may not need a separate email alias service (like SimpleLogin) if
     your email provider offers full-featured aliases i.e. which can send
     and reply from the alias email address (in addition to receive).
     Proton, Tuta and Posteo are examples of email providers who
     offer full-featured email aliases.
   - I haven't used an email alias service, but it seems that it would
     be more messy than when the feature is integrated into your email
     provider's service because *for the separate alias service*:
     * you would fill your contact list with reverse-aliases (i.e. not
       real recipient email addresses)... so this might be confusing or
       unintuitive to some people
     * if the recipient initiates the first email conversation, you
       can simply save the reverse-alias to your contact list and/or
       reply to the reverse-alias, however
       *if you initiate the first email conversation*, you need to use a
       special procedure (to obtain/calculate the reverse-alias of the
       recipient) before you can send the email
   - If you use an email alias service, you potentially expose your
     emails to an extra entity/organisation and any data breach of that
     entity... unless the email is encrypted.

## Practical ideas about multiple email addresses

Define your own email-categories, then use one email address/alias
for each category.

1. Choose email-categories based on:
   - The info/assets you are aiming to protect, e.g.
     * financial
     * health
     * identity (e.g. passport, driver's licence)
     * personal info (e.g. name, address, telephone, email address)
     * protecting your [important] mailboxes from phishing, spam, etc.
   - The trustworthiness of the person/organisation/party you are
     communicating with:
     * is the organisation big enough to have an IT Security department, *AND*
     * does the organisation care about your privacy (or are they likely
       to collect/sell/misuse your email address and data), *AND*
     * although you may trust the party (e.g. a friend) you may not
       trust the IT platform they are using (e.g. the platform has been
       previously hacked or they are known to collect/sell/misuse your
       email address and data)
   - The impact to you if:
     * the email associated with the email-category was compromised
     * the login associated with the info/asset you are aiming to protect
       (e.g. online bank account or social media account) was compromised

1. Suggested email-categories for personal email addresses/aliases:
   1. *Very high impact:*
      Organisations entrusted with your financial, health and identity assets,
      e.g. banks, superannuation, shares, government departments, tax
      department
   1. *High impact:*
      Other organisations who expect payment from you and have had or will
      have your credit card, etc. details, e.g. memberships, paid subscriptions,
      online shopping, non-government bills (e.g. phone, ISP, insurance)
   1. *Medium impact:*
      Friends, relatives, etc. (but not formal contacts for work)
   1. *Lower impact:*
      Social media, free online services, free subscriptions, free newsletters

1. Notes:
   - When I indicate *impact* above, I am attempting to convey the likely
     impact / consequences if information associated with your bank account,
     online shopping account, social media account, etc. was publicly exposed.
   - You should adapt the above lists to address your own situation,
     privacy concerns and experiences.
   - Even in my situation, the above email-categories are imperfect because:
     * I am aware of one organisation in the *very high impact* category
       where there has been a data breach
     * I suspect some organisations in the *high impact* category either
       aren't big enough to have an IT Security department or perhaps don't
       give privacy and IT security the emphasis I feel it deserves
